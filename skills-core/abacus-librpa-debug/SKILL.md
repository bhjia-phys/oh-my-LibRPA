# ABACUS + LibRPA Debug

Locate the failing stage first, then provide targeted fixes. Avoid broad blind modifications.

## Diagnosis Order

1. Identify failure stage: SCF / DF / NSCF / LibRPA.
2. Check whether inputs are mixed from different workflow chains.
3. Check stale-output contamination from previous runs.
4. Check missing or conflicting threshold parameters.

## Common Issues

- `stod` parse/read failure: check input formatting and stale files first.
- abnormal result jumps: check `nbands` against basis-size conventions.

## Output Format

- `symptom`
- `most_likely_root_cause`
- `minimal_fix_action`
- `validation_action`
- call the installed `report_stage.sh` helper to update both task Markdown logs and send the user a short stage summary
