# ABACUS + LibRPA GW

Execution order depends on system type:

- `molecule`: default to the short route `SCF -> LibRPA` unless the user explicitly needs extra band preparation; skip `pyatb`
- `solid`: `SCF -> DF (pyatb_librpa_df) -> NSCF -> preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py -> LibRPA`

If the case uses a locally merged ABACUS checkout or locally patched helper scripts, also apply `references/abacus-merge-compat.md`.

## Required Checks

- Verify `nbands` in both `INPUT_scf` and `INPUT_nscf` is equal to the basis-function count.
- Verify `INPUT_scf` and `INPUT_nscf` use the same `nbands`.
- Compute basis-function count from `.orb` files using angular-momentum degeneracy (`s=1`, `p=3`, `d=5`, `f=7`, ...), multiply by radial multiplicity, sum over all atoms in the primitive cell, and multiply by `2` when SOC is enabled.
- Cross-check the final `nbands` against `NBASE` in ABACUS output.
- Verify spin/SOC settings are aligned across files:
  - collinear spin without SOC -> `nspin = 2`, `lspinorb = 0`
  - noncollinear with SOC -> `nspin = 4`, `lspinorb = 1`
- Verify template-generated inputs using explicit lattice vectors set `latname = user_defined_lattice`.
- Verify old `exx_use_ewald` has been replaced by `exx_singularity_correction = massidda`.
- Verify `get_diel.py` uses matching `nspin` and the updated Fermi-energy parser.
- Verify `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py` matches the current wavefunction filename conventions and uses matching `use_soc` when applicable.
- Verify `librpa.in` uses matching `use_soc = 0/1`.
- Verify `librpa.in` is generated from the same ABACUS workflow chain.
- Verify the run is in a fresh directory to avoid stale-output contamination.
- If the run directory is created by copying an older case, keep only source inputs and workflow scripts; remove generated outputs such as `OUT.ABACUS`, `band_out`, `coulomb_*`, `LibRPA*.out`, `librpa.d`, `time.json`, and old `GW_band_spin_*` before submission.
- Prefer a user-curated server-side reference bundle when available.
- When generating a GW case from templates, materialize the route first with `oh-my-librpa/scripts/materialize_gw_template.sh` and treat `.oh-my-librpa-route.env` as the authoritative route record.
- Recognize the canonical file bundle from server examples:
  - `INPUT`, `INPUT_scf`, `INPUT_nscf`
  - `KPT`, `KPT_scf`, `KPT_nscf`
  - `STRU`, `geometry.in`, `librpa.in`
  - `get_diel.py`, `perform.sh`, `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py`, `run_abacus.sh`, `output_librpa.py`, `plot_gw_band_paper.py`
  - `.orb`, `.abfs`, `.upf`
- For server runs, prefer a materialized host profile (`env.sh`) with explicit `python3_exec`, executable paths, launcher paths, and any required `.bashrc` / conda activation steps instead of relying on implicit login-shell luck.

## Default `librpa.in` Preset for GW

For GW requests, set:

- `task = g0w0_band`
- `nfreq = 16`
- `option_dielect_func = 3`
- `replace_w_head = t`
- For the tested molecular short route, override with `replace_w_head = f`
- `use_scalapack_gw_wc = t`
- `use_scalapack_ecrpa = t`
- `parallel_routing = libri`
- `vq_threshold = 0`
- `sqrt_coulomb_threshold = 0`
- `use_fullcoul_exx = t`
- `output_gw_sigc_mat_rf = t`
- `libri_chi0_threshold_C = 1e-4`
- `libri_chi0_threshold_G = 1e-5`
- `libri_exx_threshold_V = 1e-1`
- `libri_exx_threshold_C = 1e-4`
- `libri_exx_threshold_D = 1e-4`
- `libri_g0w0_threshold_C = 1e-5`
- `libri_g0w0_threshold_G = 1e-5`
- `libri_g0w0_threshold_Wc = 1e-6`

## NBANDS Counting Rule

Use the `.orb` filenames to determine basis count:

- degeneracy by angular momentum: `s=1`, `p=3`, `d=5`, `f=7`, ...
- multiply each channel by its radial multiplicity in the filename
- sum over all atoms in the primitive cell
- if SOC is enabled, multiply the final total by `2`
- set the result as `nbands` in both `INPUT_scf` and `INPUT_nscf`
- verify the result against ABACUS `NBASE`

Example:

- `Ni_gga_10au_100Ry_6s3p3d2f.orb` -> `6*1 + 3*3 + 3*5 + 2*7 = 44` per Ni
- `3 Ni` atoms -> `3 * 44 = 132`
- for the full NiI2 primitive cell the total is `264` without SOC
- with SOC -> `264 * 2 = 528`
- therefore set `nbands = 528` for the SOC NiI2 case

## Spin and SOC Branches

Use the following alignment for spin-sensitive GW workflows:

- Collinear spin, no SOC:
  - `INPUT`: `nspin = 2`, `lspinorb = 0`
  - `get_diel.py`: set matching `nspin` and `use_soc = False`
  - `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py`: set `use_soc = False`
  - `librpa.in`: set `use_soc = 0`

- Noncollinear with SOC:
  - `INPUT`: `nspin = 4`, `lspinorb = 1`
  - `get_diel.py`: set matching `nspin` and `use_soc = True`
  - `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py`: set `use_soc = True`
  - `librpa.in`: set `use_soc = 1`

## System-Type Branches for GW

### Molecule

- Set `KPT` to `1 1 1`
- Treat `gamma_only` as route-aware rather than a universal hard rule
- Use official ABACUS input names from the ABACUS input reference
- Do not run `pyatb`
- Set `replace_w_head = f`
- For the tested smoke path `molecule + GW + no NSCF + no pyatb + no shrink`, materialize the dedicated route with `oh-my-librpa/scripts/materialize_gw_template.sh --case-dir <case_dir> --system-type molecule --needs-nscf false --needs-pyatb false --use-shrink-abfs false`
- Keep `out_mat_xc 1`, `exx_singularity_correction = massidda`, `exx_pca_threshold 1e-6`, `rpa_ccp_rmesh_times 6`, `exx_ccp_rmesh_times 3`, and `exx_cs_inv_thr 1e-5`
- Do not enable `out_chg`, `out_mat_r`, or `out_mat_hs2` for that short route
- Copy `OUT.ABACUS/vxc_out.dat` into the working directory as `vxc_out` before LibRPA
- Stop before LibRPA unless at least one `coulomb_mat_*.txt` file exists

### Solid

- Ask the user how many k-points to use in `KPT`; default to `8 8 8`
- `KPT_nscf` must be provided by the user
- Materialize `env.sh` from a host profile before batch submission so `python3_exec`, `abacus_work`, `librpa_work`, and the MPI launcher are explicit
- If launcher or python behavior is uncertain on compute nodes, materialize and run a batch-node probe before the real job
- Prefer the updated `get_diel.py` and `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py` copies that match the merged ABACUS branch; do not fall back to stale helpers that assume only legacy `EFERMI` parsing or one fixed wavefunction filename pattern
- After SCF, run `pyatb` to generate the `pyatb_librpa_df` directory
- Then run NSCF
- Then run `preprocess_abacus_for_librpa_band.py`
- Then run `LibRPA`

## Default Shrink Strategy

Use shrink by default for the generic periodic GW lane.

Do not force shrink onto the tested short molecular GW smoke route; that route uses `use_shrink_abfs = f` with `exx_pca_threshold 1e-6`.

Generic shrink lane:

- `use_shrink_abfs = t`
- `rpa 1`
- `exx_pca_threshold 10`
- `shrink_abfs_pca_thr 1e-4`
- `shrink_lu_inv_thr 1e-3`
- `exx_cs_inv_thr 1e-5`

Interpretation:

- `shrink_abfs_pca_thr` controls the size of the compressed auxiliary basis; default to `1e-4`.
- `shrink_lu_inv_thr` is used to control inversion-error handling for the output `sinvS`; default to `1e-3`.
- `exx_pca_threshold = 10` means the large-basis path expects external input when shrink is enabled.
- When shrink is enabled, `ABFS_ORBITAL` in `STRU` must be specified by the user.
- If the user asks how to obtain or generate those files, load `skills/abacus-librpa-abfs-orbital/`.
- If the user provides `.abfs` files, use those filenames directly in `ABFS_ORBITAL` entries.
- Server examples include names such as `Ga_str_4s4p3d2f2g_1e-4.abfs` and `As_str_4s4p3d2f2g_1e-4.abfs`.

## Stage Success Criteria

Use these generic checks for a full ABACUS + LibRPA GW chain.

Only `LibRPA` needs an explicit status judgment in the normal workflow. `pyatb` and `preprocess` are usually short and only need completion checks.

### SCF success

- `OUT.ABACUS/running_scf.log` exists
- `running_scf.log` contains both `Finish Time` and `Total Time`
- `OUT.ABACUS/ABACUS-CHARGE-DENSITY.restart` exists and is non-empty

### pyatb success

- `pyatb_librpa_df/` exists
- `pyatb_librpa_df/band_out` exists
- at least one `pyatb_librpa_df/KS_eigenvector_*.dat` file exists

### NSCF success

- `OUT.ABACUS/running_nscf.log` exists
- `running_nscf.log` contains both `Finish Time` and `Total Time`
- either `OUT.ABACUS/eig.txt` or `OUT.ABACUS/eig_occ.txt` exists and is non-empty

### preprocess success

- `band_kpath_info` exists in the working directory
- at least one `band_KS_*` file exists
- at least one `band_vxc*` file exists

### LibRPA success

- a rank-0 LibRPA output file exists, for example `librpa_para_nprocs_*_myid_0.out` or `LibRPA*.out`
- either the periodic GW outputs include at least one `GW_band_spin_*.dat` file and the rank-0 output contains `Timer stop:  total.` or `libRPA finished successfully`
- or the molecular GW outputs `band_out`, `vxc_out`, and `coulomb_mat_*.txt` exist and the rank-0 output contains `libRPA finished successfully`

### LibRPA still running

- a rank-0 LibRPA output file exists, for example `librpa_para_nprocs_*_myid_0.out` or `LibRPA*.out`
- the rank-0 output does not yet contain `Timer stop:  total.` or `libRPA finished successfully`
- the rank-0 output file is still growing

### LibRPA failed

- there is no final `Timer stop:  total.` or `libRPA finished successfully` marker
- and the rank-0 output file is no longer growing, or the output file is missing

## Periodic GW Plotting

For periodic GW post-processing, prefer the bundled `plot_gw_band_paper.py` helper.

- Inputs: `GW_band_spin_*`, `band_out`, `band_kpath_info`, `KPT_nscf`
- Outputs: a paper-style PNG, a PDF, and a text summary
- Shift energies by the GW VBM
- Restrict CBM search to the first few conduction bands near the gap to avoid high-energy spurious roots contaminating the reported gap and the main figure

## Output Requirement

For each recommendation, provide:

- why this change is needed
- what risk it addresses
- how to validate it with minimal cost
- call the installed `report_stage.sh` helper to update both task Markdown logs and send the user a short stage summary
