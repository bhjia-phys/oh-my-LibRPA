# oh-my-LibRPA

`oh-my-LibRPA` is a **chat-first** AI experience layer for `ABACUS + LibRPA` (and can be extended to other DFT stacks).

Goal: users describe tasks in natural language, and AI applies proven workflows and experience to prepare, validate, troubleshoot, and iterate GW/RPA calculations.

## Project-Local Install (Recommended)

This repository now supports **project-level installation** for three agent homes at once.

Boundary rule:

- `skills-core/` is the only source of truth for project LibRPA skills
- `platform/` is reserved for platform-specific adapters and notes

Supported targets:

- `OpenClaw` -> `.openclaw/workspace/`
- `OpenCode` -> `.opencode/`
- `Codex` -> `.codex-home/`

From the repository root:

```bash
bash install.sh --target all --layout project
```

Default behavior for project installs:

- installs all three targets
- prefers **symlinks** when the source repository is local
- keeps future updates easy: edit tracked files once, and linked installs see the changes immediately
- skips OpenClaw gateway restart unless you explicitly choose a user-level install

If you want copy mode instead of symlinks:

```bash
bash install.sh --target all --layout project --mode copy
```

## Per-Platform Install

Only OpenClaw:

```bash
bash install.sh --target openclaw --layout project
```

Only OpenCode:

```bash
bash install.sh --target opencode --layout project
```

Only Codex:

```bash
bash install.sh --target codex --layout project
```

## Legacy User-Level Install

The previous OpenClaw-style user install is still available:

```bash
bash install.sh --target openclaw --layout user
```

You can still control restart behavior explicitly:

```bash
bash install.sh --target openclaw --layout user --restart-mode immediate
bash install.sh --target openclaw --layout user --restart-mode defer
bash install.sh --target openclaw --layout user --restart-mode skip
```

## Install via AI

Send this to your AI assistant:

```

## After Installation

After installation, users can interact only through chat, for example:

- `Help me run GW for GaAs with a conservative setup first.`
- `This is a molecular system. Prepare inputs using the molecular route.`
- `How do we fix this error? Give me the minimal repair action.`

Platform-local runtime hints:

- `OpenClaw`: launch with `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE=<repo>/.openclaw/workspace`
- `Codex`: launch with `CODEX_HOME=<repo>/.codex-home`
- `OpenCode`: use the repo-local `.opencode/skills/` install or point your launcher/home override at `<repo>/.opencode`

## Current MVP Scope

- Chat orchestrator skill: `oh-my-librpa` (single entry point)
- Core workflow skills: `abacus-librpa-gw`, `abacus-librpa-rpa`, `abacus-librpa-debug`
- Rule cards (structured experience): scene, symptom, root cause, fix, verify
- Templates: minimal `INPUT_scf`, `INPUT_nscf`, `librpa.in`
- Static checker scripts and runners: intake/preflight, route-aware consistency checks, run-safety constraints, stage reporting, and GW/RPA workflow execution
- Run logging: one Markdown report in the run directory, one archived copy under the active platform root, plus short stage summaries for users
- Installer self-test: validate skills, scripts, and log-writing path right after installation

## Design Principles

- Chat-first: users should not memorize custom commands
- Routed execution: auto-route by `molecule`, `solid`, or `2D`
- Experience-driven: curated rules over ad-hoc guessing
- Safety-first: always use new run directories and avoid overwriting source data
- Project-local first: keep agent state close to the repository and easy to update

## Safety Constraints

- Prefer static checks before any remote execution
- Every run chain must use a new isolated directory
- Never overwrite original data directories
