# Installation

## For Humans

Copy this prompt to your AI agent:

```text
Install and configure oh-my-LibRPA by following:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AroundPeking/oh-my-LibRPA/main/docs/guide/installation.md
```

Or run one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AroundPeking/oh-my-LibRPA/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, users only need natural-language chat (no CLI memorization).

If installation is triggered from inside an active OpenClaw chat, the installer now keeps the conversation alive by deferring the gateway restart and printing the manual restart command.

## For LLM Agents

Fetch this guide via shell (do not summarize away actionable details):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AroundPeking/oh-my-LibRPA/main/docs/guide/installation.md
```

Then run installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AroundPeking/oh-my-LibRPA/main/install.sh | bash
```

If repository is local (development mode), run:

```bash
cd ~/code/oh-my-librpa
bash install.sh
```

## What the Installer Does

- Detect OpenClaw workspace automatically (no hard-coded path required)
- Install skills into `<workspace>/skills/`
- Install rules/templates/docs/scripts into `<workspace>/oh-my-librpa/`
- Make shipped shell scripts executable
- Run a local post-install self-test for the installed skills, scripts, and log-writing path
- Restart gateway in a normal shell install
- Defer gateway restart automatically when installation is launched from an active OpenClaw conversation, so the current chat is not interrupted

If you want to control restart behavior explicitly:

```bash
OH_MY_LIBRPA_RESTART_MODE=immediate bash install.sh
OH_MY_LIBRPA_RESTART_MODE=defer bash install.sh
OH_MY_LIBRPA_RESTART_MODE=skip bash install.sh
```

You can rerun the validation manually after installation:

```bash
~/.openclaw/workspace/oh-my-librpa/scripts/self_test.sh
```

## Validation

After install, test by chat only:

- `Help me run GW for Si with a conservative setup first.`
- `This is a molecular system. Prepare inputs with the molecular route.`
- `How do we fix this error? Give me the minimal repair action based on experience.`

Expected behavior:

- AI routes to GW/RPA/debug workflow automatically
- AI starts with intake/preflight and tells the user what is missing before execution
- AI applies curated experience rules and explains why
- AI enforces run-safety constraints (new directory, no overwrite)
